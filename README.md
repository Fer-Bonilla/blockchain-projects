# Udacity Blockchain Developer Program

Repository for Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree. You can learn the fundamentals of the blockchain platform. Create your own private blockchain, and secure a digital asset using blockchain identity.

# Course program

## 1. Blockchain Fundamentals

Learn the basics of how the blockchain data model works by creating your own private blockchain using Node.js and Leveldb.

  *Projec:* Create Your Own Private Blockchain
      Create your own private blockchain as you learn to architect a blockchain data model. Your focus will be on the development of a private chain of blocks which is cryptographically secure and immutable.

## 2. Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps. Advance your blockchain skillset to the second generation of blockchain services with smart contracts utilizing the Ethereum network.

  *Projec:* Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum
      Build a decentralized app (Dapp) that allows you to create, sell, and transfer ownership of unique star token (CryptoStar) on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and the non-fungible (ERC721) token standard

## 3. Blockchain Architecture Learn blockchain architecture and advanced concepts such as privacy, security and decentralized file management.

  *Projec:* Ethereum Dapp for Tracking Items through Supply Chain
      Learn how to manage and audit blockchain product ownership as the product is transferred down the supply chain. Improve your notarization service with a smart contract to support transferring of ownership, product auditing, and supply chain management.

## 4. Dapp with autonomous smart contracts and oracles: Advance your blockchain skill set by developing a decentralized application (Dapp) that will perform actions based on external triggers, and handle payments.

  *Projec:* Flight Delay Insurance Dapp
     Learn to build a Dapp with multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios.

## 5. Capstone. For your capstone project, you’ll use all the new skills you’ve acquired to build decentralized property listing application.

  *Projec:* Capstone
     In this project, you will represent your ownership of the property using ZK-SNARKs and then mint tokens to represent your claim to the property. You will then make these tokens available for sale on blockchain marketplace.
